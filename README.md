# Akhder
Akhder is an app to help farmers in everyday work, it consists of three main parts :
- A component responsible for the automatic irrigation of plants works by placing a sensor in the soil that periodically measures its moisture level. The soil is irrigated when the moisture level falls below a certain threshold until it reaches the desired level. These readings are sent to the application.
- A component responsible for diagnosing plant diseases using AI by taking pictures of parts of the plant leaves. It starts by determining whether the plant is sick or not.
- A component that serves as an electronic agricultural market specialized in selling and providing all the products and supplies needed by farmers.
