🌱🚀 Proud to introduce our innovative Arabic mobile app designed to revolutionize farming! 🚀🌱

Our mission: empower farmers and agricultural enthusiasts with cutting-edge technology 🤖🌾. Together with my amazing team, we combined embedded systems, deep learning, and Flutter to create a user-friendly app that makes farming smarter and more sustainable. 🌍💡

🔧 Our system includes: 🌿 A moisture detection sensor to automatically irrigate plants and alert users when attention is needed. 📱 Plant scanning that detects diseases, helping farmers keep track of plant health and receive real-time guidance on the best treatments. 🧑‍🌾🌱

🌟 In addition, we developed an in-app marketplace, where users can find specialized farming products to enhance their crops’ aesthetics and health. 🌻🌾

What sets us apart? 💡

We didn’t just design an app, we built a small sensor to integrate with the platform, taking precision farming to the next level! 🚜
Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, we created an advanced plant disease detection feature, enabling farmers to accurately identify plant issues at the earliest stage. Not only that, our app provides treatment hints based on the disease, complete with Arabic prescriptions for ease of understanding, helping users implement solutions right away! 🌿💊
Our in-app marketplace connects users with trusted products for plant care and treatment. This marketplace ensures that farmers get everything they need — from disease treatments to products that improve plant aesthetics — all in one place, making farming smarter and more efficient. 🌱🛍️
I am beyond proud of the hard work and collaboration that went into every part of this project. Huge thanks to my team for their dedication and expertise! 🙌👩‍💻👨‍💻

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to grow and innovate in the world of farming tech! 🌍🌿 #Farming #AgricultureTech #DeepLearning #CNN #EmbeddedSystems #Innovation #MachineLearning #Flutter #IoT #Marketplace
